COP4813 Project 1
A Python streamlit framework web application. User would select a category of news articles from the New York Times. Then, using the New York Times API the application would gather the top articles, find the most common words, and generate a wordcloud image.

NOTE:
Visual polish was never a design goal of this project. Basic functionality was key.
